# TracerouteVisualization
Inspired by Computerphile's video, I made my own traceroute visualization, now with individual hops (realtime) as suggested by a YouTube comment.

Very hacky and should not be depended on, but it works. Run `python geolocate.py www.mydomain.com`. I used ImageMagick to save a GIF of the animation. Consider playing around with the colors to make it look green and black like the movies.
